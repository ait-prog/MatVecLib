MatVecLib is a module for linear and vector algebra that provides functions for working with matrices and vectors. The library includes operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of matrices, as well as calculating determinants, traces, and inverses. All functions are accompanied by unit tests to ensure reliability. The library was compared with NumPy, and results were visualized to better understand the performance and algorithm complexity (Big O notation).
